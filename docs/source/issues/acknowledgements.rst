We wish to thank Paul Butler, Debra Fischer, Geoff Marcy and Sharon Wang for many useful conversations and inputs on radial velocity extraction from iodine based data.

In our software, we use spectral atlases of the Sun and Arcturus as reference spectra for a first velocity guess. This data has been collected and published by `Hinkle et al. (2000) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000vnia.book.....H/abstract>`_, and can be downloaded for free from the `Astro Data Lab at NSFâ€™s NOIRLab <https://noirlab.edu/science/data-services/other>`_, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.
